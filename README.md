Solar Panel Disconnections Detection For Fluence Energy, 2024

Milestone 1:
• Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns related to string disconnections and
degradation.
• Define performance metrics for disconnection and degradation detection.
– Feature Enginerring



Milestone 2:
• Develop a model to detect the disconnection of a single string with monitoring data
aggregated from 2 strings.
• Incorporate a component for detecting long-term degradation, distinguishing it from
disconnection issues.
• Validate the combined model on test data, ensuring it can distinguish between
disconnections and gradual degradation.
